                                This was our first romantic time spent and the second time we met in person. Nikki invited me to her birthday trip to Asheville weeks ago and we had an amazing time doing activism together, eating downtown, attending a vegfest, and visited an animal sanctuary. We stayed at an air bnb outside the city in the mountains and it was truly a magical experience!

                                We laid out everything. All of our deal breakers, red flags...all in a google document that we signed on this day. Nikki was ready to sign it on September 11, 2021.

                                There was a week long animal rights event in Chicago hosted by Animal Activism Mentorship that Nikki attended. I messaged her on facebook and told her ,"Great job!". We joked about the vegan singles group. I'd accompany her on her 2-hour car rides home from activist events. We would chat at night and my mom even joked about how I was in love. Everything started platonically and eventually grew into something more.

                            <p>
                                We were both with someone else, but we met for the first time in a parking lot in Orlando at an animal rights outreach event hosted by Shannon Blair. We didn't talk to each other much, but this introduction was critical in connecting later. Naturally, we admired each other's willingness to speak up for innocent animals.
