                              We were both with someone else, but we met for the first time in a parking lot in Orlando at an animal rights outreach event hosted by Shannon Blair. We didn't talk to each other much, but this introduction was critical in connecting later. Naturally, we admired each other's willingness to speak up for innocent animals.

                              You attended a week long animal rights event in Chicago hosted by Animal Activism Mentorship (AAM) and I messaged you on facebook to tell you ,"Great job!". A few days later, we joked about the vegan singles group and just kept talking more and more. We'd accompany each other on car rides home from activist events and also chatted all night sometimes. My mom even teased me about how I was in love. Everything started platonically and eventually grew into something more.

                              This was our first romantic time spent and the second time we met in person. We had an awesome time doing activism together, eating downtown, attending a vegfest, and visited an animal sanctuary, Animal Haven of Asheville. We stayed at an air bnb outside the city in the mountains and it was truly a magical experience!

                              You met my mom for the first time and this was a special moment for me. We protested against horse-drawn carriages and asked people why it wasn't ok to eat dogs in Rittenhouse square.

He was talented and even played keys with a stuffed banana. His dinga-ling was all over the place in one of his outfits LOL! And remember the terrible picture I took of us where my face looked bloated?
